-	When moving screen right or left, vertical lines from the other edge of the screen are being drawn.
o	Took me ~5 min to find bug (it was that I was comparing plane offset of the row to write to the starting plane instead of comparing the plane itself to the starting plane)
o	Fixed it in a second.
-	Status bar is just mirroring top of screen
o	Took me ~30 min to realize I put wrong value when initializing registers, accidently turned on a random field.
-	Status bar is in middle of screen
o	Took me ~10 min to learn that every address in VRAM is doubled
o	Just multiplied Line Compare field by 2.
-	status_msg is never nonzero for printing condition
o	took me an hour to learn that the message is only nonzero when we type something and hit enter.
-	Printing status_msg was segfaulting
o	Took me 30 minutes to realize I was copying status_msg to a declared char pointer, not one with allocated space already. 
o	Took me 5 min to fix the bug in text_to_bar (copying to a char array of 41 chars.)
-	Status bar wasn’t printing characters after the end of the string I copied to the inside of it
o	Took me an hour to realize it’s because the string is NULL terminated
o	Took me 20 minutes to overwrite the null character in the status bar.
